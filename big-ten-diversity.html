          <img src="images/stories/diversity.jpg">
          <p>Story by Chris Bowling for the Daily Nebraskan | April 27, 2015</p>
          <p class="storytext">Sriyani Tidball was alone after she moved to the United States.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Alone in the sense that in the late ‘60s, out of six grades at Lincoln East High School, the Sri Lanka native was the only person of color in the school. No black students. No Hispanic students. No student of any race aside from white was represented because at that time those students generally only went to Lincoln High School.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But she said it wasn’t bad. People didn’t feel uncomfortable around her like she assumed they might around an American-born person of color. Eventually, living in that world became normal.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“I was kind of used to being the non-white person,” Tidball said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">She then attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and went on to work in advertising professionally. In 2008, she came back to Lincoln to work at UNL as an assistant professor of practice in the advertising department.</p>
          <p class="storytext">As 1 of 5 people of color, and 1 of 3 women of color, on faculty in UNL’s College of Journalism and Mass Communications, Tidball said she doesn’t work in a diverse environment.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“Whether it’s the students or the faculty, it’s extremely lacking,” Tidball said. “I think we’re all aware of it, but that’s just the way it is.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">With a minority faculty population of 19 percent, UNL is second-to-last in the Big Ten Conference and two percentage points below the national average found in a 2011 study conducted by the Institute of Education Sciences. And although this minority population has increased over the years, from about 9 percent in 1996 to 19 percent today, Tidball said she isn’t seeing much growth.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“You can say when it goes from two to three, you’ve seen a 50 percent increase,” Tidball said. “So yeah, I’ve seen that, but the numbers are so small anyway.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">For Tidball, the day-to-day sense of isolation, dealing with inadvertently ignorant comments and forming close relationships with other staff members of color haven’t changed. But even though she’s aware of the undertones, they aren’t at the forefront of her mind when she comes to work.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Tidball said it’s obvious there’s no one like her. She’s come to grips with who she is and feels that in a lot of situations, being a woman of color is an advantage. One such advantage is working closely with minority students.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Tidball said she’s lucky if she has one student of color in one of her classes. When she does, she goes out of her way to connect with that person. Although she helps students build a resume or portfolio, more importantly, she makes them feel welcome and comfortable.</p>
          <p class="storytext">It’s a sentiment that students of color such as junior broadcasting major Mecca Slaughter appreciate.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“I am surrounded by white people,” said Slaughter, who’s also a member of the Establishment of the Chancellor’s Commission on the Status of People of Color, a new student group charged with promoting inclusion. “Three out of five of my classes, I am the only black person. All my teachers are white this semester.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">While minorities represent 19 percent of faculty, they only account for 11 percent of the student body. And even that number seems surprising to Slaughter who said she didn’t even realize there were other students that looked like her until she got more connected on campus. And being singled out because of her race can have an adverse effect on her learning, she said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“It affects my learning when I get looked at for the answers to things,” Slaughter said. “It affects my learning when I am afraid to speak up or ask a question because I will be looked at weird.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">In addition, she said there’s an expectation as a student of color who’s passionate about change to be a spokesperson for an entire group of people. And saying the same things over and over about how lack of diversity hurts her learning or what students can do to promote inclusivity can wear her down.</p>
          <p class="storytext">That’s why she values when she can make a connection with a faculty member of color. She said there’s an established understanding between the two because both groups are dealing with the same issues, just on opposite sides of the classroom.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“When I had a professor that looked like me, I was more engaged,” Slaughter said. “I wanted to do the best I could because they reminded me of my mom, an aunt, an uncle or someone from church. I was connected and we understood the struggle.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">But understanding the problem is only half the issue. While both Tidball and Slaughter agree that it’s realistic for UNL to one day be as diverse as universities such as Rutgers or the University of Michigan, which lead the Big Ten in minority faculty at 38 percent of overall faculty, solutions aren’t concrete.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Slaughter said the best way to promote change is to create a comfortable campus, while Tidball suggested adding more degrees that would attract people of color.</p>
          <p class="storytext">After an Oct. 2 address from Chancellor Harvey Perlman promoting ideas of inclusivity, Juan Franco, vice chancellor of student affairs, said one way to create a diverse staff is to let them know of the opportunity to make a difference. He also said UNL needs to look toward recruiting graduates of more diverse schools.</p>
          <p class="storytext">When asked if UNL is doing a good job of promoting diversity, Georgia Jones, a member of the chancellor’s commission on the status of people of color, said all organizations have room for improvement. She also said it’s too early to talk about the role of her group in negotiating ways to seek out that improvement as new members were announced March 23. But she did say that diversity is extremely important and the university needs to nurture it.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“We don’t live alone,” Jones said. “We have connections with other people and we have an obligation to address that every day.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">But no matter what method is implemented, it’s people like Andrew Saunders, who works in the recruitment center, that will see first-hand whether it works.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Saunders, a senior broadcasting major, said he doesn’t think the recruitment center does a good enough job of educating its employees about the issues of diversity. He said they don’t talk about it at all and have no training on how to address the issue with a concerned prospective student or parent.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“You could look at it in a negative or a positive way,” Saunders said. “You could say, ‘Well, times are changing and people aren’t thinking of it like that,’ but at the same time, with things that are going on today, we should address these issues.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">He said the only nod the center gives to addressing diversity is by having him or the other black person in the office call the major cities.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Saunders, who’s from a south suburb of Chicago, is well versed in diversity. Having come from a high school that was split down the middle between whites and blacks, he said crossing ethnic boundaries was never a foreign idea to him. But when he decided to come to Nebraska after primarily touring all-black schools, he immediately knew he was in a different atmosphere.</p>
          <p class="storytext">When he and his mom visited UNL, one of the first things she did was pull up next to a black girl walking down the street to ask her what it was like to be a black student at UNL. The girl was upfront that it can get weird at times: One girl had recently refused to partner up with her because she had never worked with a black person before.</p>
          <p class="storytext">That, coupled with the occasional offensive things he’ll hear walking down the street, such as the N-word, “coon” and “go back where you came from,” have made an impression on Saunders.</p>
          <p class="storytext">And even though he said it doesn’t faze him, he can see how this would be a big turn-off to prospective students. Saunders said fostering diversity needs to be a group effort, and leaders’ willingness to try new things will allow for real change.</p>
          <p class="storytext">For addressing the issues of race and inclusivity here and now, Tidball does have concrete plans to affect individual students’ outcomes and personal connections.</p>
          <p class="storytext">She said those connections are her favorite part of the job. She recalled a recent conversation with a black student who almost dropped out of UNL because, among other things, she felt the same feeling of isolation that Tidball and Slaughter said is prevalent in their lives.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But today, she’s a sophomore because she met other students who empathized with her and had professors, like Tidball, who reached out.</p>
          <p class="storytext">To Tidball, that’s how you can start to tackle the huge, ongoing issue of race that carries with it years of empirical and emotional testaments to its effects. For her, it’s about providing personal connections and making people from any background feel welcome. One student at a time.</p>
