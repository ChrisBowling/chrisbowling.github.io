          <h1 class="storytitle2">Death Penalty Battle in Nebraska just beginning</h1>
          <img src="images/stories/dp.jpg">
          <p>Story by Chris Bowling for the Norfolk Daily News | August 20, 2015</p>
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <p class="storytext">Coming into last year's legislative session, state Sen. Paul Schumacher didn't have a strong opinion on the death penalty.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"My predisposition was that we have the best of both worlds," said the Columbus legislator.</p>
          <p class="storytext">What he meant was that because Nebraska hadn't executed anyone since 1997, it made the death penalty practically nonexistent, and that appeased opponents. But having it as state law allowed county attorneys across the state the benefit using the threat of it in negotiating plea deals.</p>
          <p class="storytext">As a former Platte County attorney, Schumacher respected that.</p>
<p class="storytext">But by the end of the 2015 legislative session, Schumacher was praising the repeal of the death penalty in Nebraska, and a photo of him bumping arms in celebration with state Sen. Ernie Chambers of Omaha was an image that helped rally death penalty supporters.
The Legislature voted to repeal the death penalty via Legislative Bill 268 and, later, to override Gov. Pete Ricketts' veto by a vote of 30-19 — the exact number needed to preserve the repeal.
          <p class="storytext">It's a decision that's spurred a petition drive to place the issue before Nebraska voters in 2016, provided tangible proof of the effects of term limits for state lawmakers and caused a statewide and even national examination of capital punishment in Nebraska.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Each side has opinions on how the decision came to be. For proponents of repeal, it was a practical decision resulting from a broken system. But for the opposition, it was an out-of-touch Legislature not making good on its constituents' wishes.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The latter is how Vivian Tuttle of Norfolk and many others around the state feel.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Tuttle is the mother of Evonne Tuttle, who was one of five people killed in the 2002 U.S. Bank shootings in Norfolk. She wants the perpetrators of that horrific crime — Jorge Galindo, Erick Vela and Jose Sandoval — given the sentence handed to them: the death penalty.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Vivian Tuttle, who was part of an effort to raise public support for the death penalty as the Legislature debated the issue this spring, said the situation is a direct result of bad politics.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"We wanted people to know what was going on, and we wanted people to get a hold of their senators," she said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Many tried but weren’t given an opportunity to speak in person with lawmakers and express their support for retaining the death penalty.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"They (senators) went ahead and voted how they wanted to," she said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Now Tuttle and others like her around Nebraska are gathering signatures as part of a petition drive financially backed by Nebraskans for the Death Penalty, of which Ricketts' $200,000 donation comprises nearly a third of funding.</p>
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <a href="http://www.norfolkdailynews.com/app/editorial/graph1.html" class="graphictext">Death Row on the Rise. View the graphic here.</a>
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <p class="storytext">Tuttle, like some others, isn't taking any compensation for her work and guesses that she'll spend more than $2,000 of her own money traveling to towns to circulate petitions.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But it’s worth it, she said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The purpose is to allow Nebraskans to vote on repealing LB268 and thereby retain the death penalty. The possibility also exists that, if enough additional signatures are collected, that LB268 would not become law until the 2016 vote is taken. If that happens, those individuals on Nebraska’s death row will remain on the path toward execution.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Schumacher said the Legislature's action came from a policy-focused effort to hear out both sides and see what did and didn't work about Nebraska's system.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Schumacher said that, in his opinion, proponents of the death penalty ended up making the weaker argument. At the legislative hearing on the issue, for example, there were more than 40 advocates of repeal who testified, while just one testified in favor of retaining the death penalty.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Schumacher, who has a legal practice in Columbus, sums up the arguments against the death penalty in terms of the standard four reasons for criminal punishment: deterrence, rehabilitation, incapacitation and retribution.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Of the four, deterrence — keeping similar acts from happening again — has always been touted by those in favor of the death penalty. The governor, for example, has used the argument of public and police safety multiple times as a need for the death penalty.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But when proponents of repeal shared studies showing the death penalty's presence had no definitive effect on violent crime — and supporters couldn’t present an effective counter-argument — Schumacher said it was clear to him that deterrence isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"The overwhelming evidence shows that the death penalty, or even a life sentence, isn't on people's mind when they commit a murder," Schumacher said. "For deterrent purposes, it's not there, and such a weakness in the argument of people for the death penalty was a major consideration by the Legislature."</p>
          <p class="storytext">In addition, rehabilitation — the effort to build a more productive member of society — and incapacitation, which is taking a criminal out of the societal equation, are irrelevant when deciding between a life sentence and the death penalty, he said. Either way, offenders aren't reintroduced to the public.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The lawmaker said the only true argument brought forth for retaining the death penalty focused on retribution — the eye-for-an-eye argument.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Schumacher said he believes that, in most cases, the death penalty is a false promise because the lengthy appeals process and the lack of the needed lethal drugs to execute leave almost all on death row. In the cases where the death penalty is carried out, it addresses only a select few, he said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"That disparity between a small, small percentage of victims' families who get that retribution and the large number of those who do not is a real problem," Schumacher said. "It's an indication of some kind of imbalance in the system."</p>
          <p class="storytext">Tuttle said the appeals process is the first thing that needs to be fixed if Nebraska votes to reinstate the death penalty. One idea would be to offer 90 days of hearings and appeals at each level — local, state, national and again on the local level — to expedite the process.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But that may not be realistic. No state has achieved anything like that. Even someone sentenced to death in Texas — the state responsible for almost 40 percent of executions in the past 10 years — has an average time on death row of 10.87 years.</p>
          <p class="storytext">State Sen. Jim Scheer of Norfolk said there's a reason the appeals process is so thorough.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"If we're going to have true justice, you have to make sure they have the ample opportunity to protect their rights and their ability to prove their innocence," said Scheer, who voted against the repeal of the death penalty.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Scheer is among those who don’t believe the death penalty serves as a true deterrent, but he also strongly believes that government still has a responsibility to dole out appropriate punishments for heinous crimes.</p>
          <p class="storytext">He said the death penalty also has value as a bargaining chip for lawyers involved in prosecuting cases. The fact that many lawyers in Nebraska did not want to see LB268 passed is a testament to that.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Schumacher said that, in the past, he felt the same way. Threatening to pursue the death penalty was an effective tool to get low-cost plea deals that makes taxpayers and county boards happy while cutting around technicalities in the legal system.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But the problem, he said, is that it's proven on more than one occasion to be too effective of a tool.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Look at the Beatrice Six of 1985 in which six people were incarcerated on a plea deal obtained by threatening the death penalty — in addition to falsified evidence from a forensic investigator. The accused were released in 2009 when further evidence found them innocent. The state's paid over a million dollars for the wrongful convictions.</p>
          <p class="storytext">For the most part, these opinions and talking points aren't new information.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Many Nebraskans are well aware that Chambers has introduced a bill to repeal to the death penalty every session he's served as a senator since 1976, except from 2009 to 2012 when he was out of the Legislature.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The last time it came close to reaching this point was 1979 when it was vetoed by then-Gov. Charles Thone.</p>
          <p class="storytext">So what about this year was different?</p>
          <p class="storytext">Both sides agree that one of the main factors was the influx of new state senators, a result of enacting term limits on lawmakers of two four-year terms.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Seventeen new senators were sworn in this past session — over a third of the Legislature. Of those 17, 10 voted to pass LB268, as well as to override the governor's veto.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The impact of the presence of new senators is viewed differently by each side of the debate.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Tuttle said she believes the new group of senators was more interested in personal convictions than protecting or bettering the state as a whole.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"They were easy enough to sway because they were told that's what you do," she said. "You trade votes so you can get what you want."</p>
          <p class="storytext">Schumacher disagrees, saying there's an answer more practical than that.</p>
          <p class="storytext">When you substitute out such a large number of senators, the Unicameral is going to surprise voters with decisions that reflect a morphing legislative body.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"You're going to see this over and over with term limits," Schumacher said. "You're going to see large numbers of new people coming in and thus what you thought was a political landscape is not that way, and what you thought was a viable idea is not. And what you thought would never see the light of day becomes something openly discussed."</p>

          <h1 class="storytitle2">Will others follow Nebraska's lead on death penalty repeal?</h1>
          <p>Story by Chris for the Norfolk Daily News | August 21, 2015</p>
          <p class="storytext">It’s no surprise — especially for those who keep abreast of the politics of capital punishment — that support for the death penalty has generally been decreasing.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In recent years, some religious groups, fiscal conservatives, moderate Democrats and others have come out against it, so policy experts like Robert Dunham were expecting that more states might vote to repeal it.</p>
          <p class="storytext">What he didn't expect was that it would happen in Nebraska — and for it to happen in 2015.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"If you'd asked observers in 2014 or 2015 whether Nebraska was going to be the breakthrough state, very few of them would have put their money on that," Dunham said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">After the Nebraska Legislature’s vote to  repeal, national media, political groups and others analyzed how one of the most seemingly conservative states came to take a stand against the death penalty.</p>
          <p class="storytext">And one of the more pressing questions was this: What kind of effect will this have on the rest of the country?</p>
          <p class="storytext">Dunham is the executive director of deathpenaltyinfo.org, which is one of the largest resources for death penalty information and is based in Washington, D.C.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The Nebraska Legislature’s vote, he said, is an indication of an accelerating, emerging trend.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Even though it came as a surprise to many, Dunham said it actually falls in place with what experts have been tracking across the nation.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In the 1990s, when public support for capital punishment was at 80 percent, death penalty opposition was politically toxic for legislators because the conversation centered on fear of crime. But with results of some studies downplaying the death penalty's effects on crime, national support for the death penalty as a means of public safety has dropped to 7 percent.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The conversation, in other words, has changed dramatically.</p>
          <p class="storytext">From Dunham’s perspective, a bill introduced by an independent senator — Ernie Chambers of Omaha — that received support from a Legislature of mostly registered Republicans represents a pivotal moment in the death penalty debate. It likely will send a strong signal to other states, he said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"You'll see more bills seeking to repeal the death penalty, you'll see more action being taken on those bills and you'll see more instances in which they succeed," Dunham said.</p>

          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <p class="storytext">Dunham said that’s not surprising because the issues brought up during debate on the potential repeal of the death penalty aren't limited to Nebraska.</p>
          <p class="storytext">As the state with the second-most executions in the nation over the last 40 years, Florida is one of the front-runners in terms of modern-day use of capital punishment. However, Florida is also the top state in individuals on death row subsequently being exonerated.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Charles M. Harris, a senior judge in the fifth appellate court in Florida, was appointed to the circuit bench in 1984 after 20 years of general civil practice. Part of the procedure when he was being considered for the bench required him to give his views on the death penalty.</p>
          <p class="storytext">At the time, Harris said, he had no real opinion on the issue.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But after serving on the bench for years, retiring to serve as a senior judge and working with the Florida Governor's Commission of Capital Cases, he said it became clear to him that the death penalty didn't have much going for it.</p>
          <p class="storytext">During his years as a judge, Harris sentenced a man to death for the 1979 rape and murder of a 6-year old girl. The offender, Brian Jennings, has been on death row for more than 30 years because of appeals and legal technicalities.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Harris said the case is a clear example of how someone can, in effect, capitalize on the criminal justice system, robbing victims' families of peace and a state of money.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But he doesn’t necessarily see Nebraska’s vote as a trend-setter.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"I was happy to see it, but there has been a trend lately for states to repeal the death penalty," Harris said. "It has not affected the way we do things here, and I doubt the Nebraska experience will make a difference."</p>
          <p class="storytext">Recently there was a movement in Florida's Legislature to adopt a policy that a death sentence can be ordered only by a unanimous jury. That kind of an approach, which is in place in some other states, failed to generate enough support. So, in Florida, a jury needs only to reach a two-thirds majority, but a judge can override the jury on a death penalty sentence.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"For as long as I can recall, up to the present moment, Florida citizens favor the death penalty (as) a two-thirds majority," Harris said. "The Legislature is well aware of this fact so I expect no movement there."</p>
<p class="storytext">He said the only change he can see affecting Florida would have to come from a U.S. Supreme Court decision.
    That isn’t likely either given the high court's split on the issue, highlighted in the recent Glossip v. Gross case.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In his opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote that he believed the death penalty may violate the Eighth Amendment, calling its constitutionality into question. However, Justice Antonin Scalia called Breyer's 46-page opinion "gobbledy-gook," saying the U.S. Constitution provides people with the ability and right to choose capital punishment.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In addition, although many states are introducing bills limiting the death penalty or aiming to abolish it, it’s not a sweeping reform.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Last year, lawmakers in 14 states introduced bills that would abolish the death penalty, but of them Nebraska was the only one that prevailed.</p>
<p class="storytext">There were also a number of bills that expanded capital punishment.
    Several states proposed bills that would keep the providers of the drugs needed to execute someone confidential. Among those bills, the measures in Arkansas and Texas passed, while bills in Mississippi and Virginia were defeated in the final steps.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In addition, Utah reinstated the firing range in the absence of lethal injections and Indiana made beheading legal in a punishment for murder. North Carolina also expanded who can be licensed to perform lethal injections.</p>

          <h1 class="storytitle2">Conflicting opinions expressed on carrying out death penalty</h1>
          <p>Story by Chris Bowling for the Norfolk Daily News | August 22, 2015</p>
          <p class="storytext">LINCOLN — On the day of the vote in the Legislature this spring to repeal the death penalty in Nebraska, Miriam Thimm Kelle of Beatrice was on edge.</p>
<p class="storytext">For her, that day was the culmination of a 20-year journey to make sure no other family had to go through the pain that her family had dealt with since 1980 when her brother, James Thimm, was killed.</p>
<p class="storytext">His killer, Michael Ryan, a cult leader who tortured and murdered James Thimm in Rulo, Neb., spent more than 30 years on death row before dying of brain cancer earlier this year.</p>
<p class="storytext">At first, Thimm Kelle and her family were sure that the death penalty would be carried out and supported that.</p>
<p class="storytext">But 10 years later, when it was becoming clear that wouldn't happen, Thimm Kelle started speaking out — in an effort to keep other families from waiting for an execution day that may never come.</p>
<p class="storytext">The Legislature’s decision to repeal the death penalty — and an override of a veto by Gov. Pete Ricketts — may make it look like Thimm Kelle’s perspective was on target.</p>
<p class="storytext">But the reality is the issue isn’t over. The death penalty in Nebraska isn’t going down without a fight.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>

          <div class="spacer"></div>
<p class="storytext">After the legislative action, the Nebraskans for the Death Penalty organization immediately started a petition drive to gain signatures to place the issue on the November 2016 ballot.</p>
<p class="storytext">The success of those efforts will soon be known, as Thursday, Aug. 27, is the deadline for collecting signatures of registered voters.</p>
<p class="storytext">The effort to put the issue on the ballot has been opposed by the Nebraskans for Public Safety organization, which is made up of those who oppose the death penalty and feel it creates financial and moral problems.</p>
<p class="storytext">Danielle Conrad, executive director of the Nebraska ACLU in Lincoln and a member of Nebraskans for Public Safety, said the petition drive didn’t come as a shock.</p>
<p class="storytext">"I wouldn't say it was a surprise by any means, but I would say that there was a level of disappointment among a variety of different people who worked very hard on this issue for many years," Conrad said. "We're really ready to move to more positive priorities impacting our state."</p>
<p class="storytext">But for people like Vivian Tuttle of Norfolk, the death penalty — the ability to exact the ultimate punishment on the perpetrators of the most heinous crimes — is a fundamental piece of government's responsibility that can't be lost.</p>
<p class="storytext">Tuttle lost her daughter, Evonne, in the 2002 U.S. Bank shootings in Norfolk, and she's been driving across the state to different counties on her own dollar, sharing her story and criticizing state senators who voted to repeal the death penalty against the wishes of a majority of their constituents.</p>
          <p class="storytext">She carries with her a photo of her daughter taken just a few days before her death.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Like Thimm Kelle, Tuttle also wants to keep families from waiting years for the death penalty to be carried out. But unlike Thimm Kelle, Tuttle has faith in the system.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Tuttle said she's spoken to the governor, who has personally promised her he'll be able to obtain the drugs necessary for lethal injection.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Ricketts has been an outspoken proponent of the death penalty from the start, citing its purpose for public and police safety.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In May, Ricketts spearheaded the process of buying quantities of sodium thiopental and pancuronium bromide — the needed drugs used in the lethal injection combination, for $54,400 to prove that the Nebraska execution system could follow through on a sentence. That’s something it hadn't done since 1997.</p>
          <p class="storytext">However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wouldn't allow the transaction as importation was outlawed due to the drug's producers not wanting their medicine used to execute. So the purchase remains in limbo.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Ricketts has donated $200,000 to Nebraskans for the Death Penalty, the group financially backing the petition for a referendum on the death penalty.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Death penalty supporters said there's nothing wrong with Ricketts backing a cause he believes in. There are no legal barriers to the governor’s contributions, either. According to Frank Daley, director of the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission, there’s nothing legally wrong about Ricketts’ donations.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Others, like Conrad, see it differently.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Conrad said the governor financially backing such a large portion of the petition drive’s cost tends to undermine his statements that there's an overwhelming number of Nebraskans behind the movement.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But Ron Stauffer of Norfolk, who has helped lead the petition-gathering process in Norfolk, said he has more of a problem with Conrad's organization.</p>
          <p class="storytext">He said the $400,000 the Nebraskans for Public Safety received as a donation from the Proteus Action League in Massachusetts is seeking to keep Nebraskans from being able to have a say on the issue — regardless of what side they're on.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"This isn't about the death penalty," Stauffer said. "This is about the citizens making a choice, and that's the only reason I got involved."</p>
          <p class="storytext">To Sen. Colby Coash of Lincoln, who co-sponsored Legislative Bill 268 that resulted in the repeal of the death penalty, the entire situation is an example of why he believes a majority of state senators voted for repeal.</p>
          <p class="storytext">For a system that hasn't been implemented since 1997, what’s the benefit of keeping a broken system alive, he asks.
Coash, who grew up in Bassett, said anyone who thinks now is the time to be able to simply and easily fix the problems with the death penalty is misguided.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"Look, we had 10 years of (former Gov. Dave) Heineman, who was very pro death penalty and had supported it," Coash said. "Senator (Ernie) Chambers was gone for four of those 10 years. Don't you think if it was possible, (Heineman) would have already tried?"</p>
          <p class="storytext">One of the main things that bothers Thimm Kelle about the debate is the money that's been donated and spent. She said the money would be better spent on new reforms like increasing mental health treatment.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"I don't have $1 million to put into this," Thimm Kelle said. "If I did, I would. All I have is our story and my hope for Nebraska to let go of the old, move to the new and prevent this from happening to another family. Because it's awful living like this all the time."</p>
          <p class="storytext">But petitions around the state gather more signatures every day. Although Nebraskans for the Death Penalty isn't releasing any numbers on how many signatures have been gathered, individuals like Stauffer and Tuttle said they believe the effort will reach the 58,000 benchmark needed to get the death penalty referendum on the 2016 ballot.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Sen. Paul Schumacher of Columbus, who voted for the repeal, has serious questions about what purpose all of this work is trying to serve. Throughout debate in the Legislature, Schumacher said he thought it was made clear the death penalty wasn't protecting the public and that its only redeeming value was retribution for the families.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"Is the feel good, the sense of retribution of a tiny number of families worth hiring some guy in India to scour the black market of Third World countries looking for drugs?" Schumacher said. "Is it worth the tremendous expense? Is it worth the chance that it might be wrong?"</p>
          <p class="storytext">Even though it’s been a fight lasting for four decades, state Sen. Ernie Chambers of Omaha said he’s not concerned about the forces working against him and other repeal advocates.</p>
          <p class="storytext">"My train is not off the track because the governor is trying to buy what he couldn't win," Chambers said. "My train is not off the track because the Republican Party couldn't bully the senators they had in the Legislature to vote the way they wanted them to."</p>
          <p class="storytext">If the issue gets on the ballot and passes, he's not going to back down. Chambers said he’s determined to see the issue through.</p>
         <p class="storytext">"I'm not going away," Chambers said. "I'll push what I believe in.”</p>
