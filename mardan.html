          <h1 class="storytitle2"> A Signature Away: Lincoln Yazidi's long struggle to America</h1>
          <img src="images/stories/mardan.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Story and photo by Chris Bowling | May 1, 2015</p>
          <p class="storytext">After a dinner of naan, duqot and fried chicken, Mardan Dna sinks into his living room couch while Yazidi wedding music plays in the background.</p>
              <p class="storytext">His family - five sisters, mother, father and brother - likes to watch videos of the extravagant weddings that look like the one Dna and his wife had a few years ago when they were still living in northern Iraq.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But Dna isn’t living in Iraq anymore.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Despite the Kurdish they speak to fill the gaps in their English, the wedding videos they play on repeat in the small living room or the peacock, a symbol in Yazidi faith - sitting on a dresser next to a small bust of Abraham Lincoln - Iraq is the past. Lincoln is the present.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“When we came over, we forget about there,” Dna said. “Like we forget to start over.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Dna and his family are refugees in Lincoln, having escaped their war-torn homes.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The word “fate” comes up a lot in Dna’s story of how he made it to America. He sees it that way because at every step of the way there were people who entered his life, sometimes by strokes of luck, to help get him out of Iraq.</p>
          <p class="storytext">He believes in the power of people. Without them, he wouldn’t be where he is today, sitting in a home in Lincoln, Nebraska, with his parents, siblings and a newborn daughter, speculating about a future full of possibility.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But all the while, he remembers the long road from home.</p>
          <p class="storytext">***</p>
          <p class="storytext">Dna started working for the U.S. military in 2006 through a U.S. company called L3, which later became Titan.</p>
          <p class="storytext">He had just graduated college in Dohuk, Iraq, and wanted to use the English skills he’d learned studying science to become an interpreter for the U.S. military and avoid teaching, his only other option post-graduation. The problem was he needed a way in.</p>
          <p class="storytext">A friend of his, Salem, worked on a local base the summer before and knew the boss well.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“So, he remembered that I said, ‘I want to work for the Army, but there’s no key to get in,’” Dna said. “‘I have a key,’ [he said].”</p>
          <p class="storytext">So, he gave him an in and directed him away from the dangerous base where the military was going to station him, toward a safer one.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But when they finally made the trip to the safer base, they came too late. Dna said he and his friend saw a line of about 20 to 30 people trying to get work as translators.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“Shit,” he thought. Dna said he doubted they’d land jobs, but his friend told him not to worry about it. Just then, Salem’s connection came through.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“Then I saw one Humvee come up,” Dna said. “The manager of L3 came out and hugged with my friend, shaked my hand and asked, ‘Are you Mardan?’”</p>
          <p class="storytext">In that moment, Dna said he knew he was safe.</p>
          <p class="storytext">For the next few years, he worked with the base defense operations center, protecting the perimeters and gates, searching for weapons in bunkers built during the reign of Saddam Hussein and building relationships with civilians in nearby towns. He was also on a quick reaction force, which was responsible for responding to emergencies on a moment’s notice.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But Dna said even though there were a lot of tense situations where his unit was ready to fire at a moment’s notice, he never faced any real action. What really impacted his time working for the military were the great relationships he built with the American soldiers.</p>
          <p class="storytext">They looked out for him outside and on the base. Dna said he remembered the words of his boss responding to a marine who was mistreating Dna: “You don’t mess with my interpreter. Our lives are up to them.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Drew Miller, a junior global studies and political science major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, works at Catholic Social Services as a caseworker, resettling families like Dna’s. He said hearing phrases like the one Dna recalled from soldiers who worked with his clients isn’t uncommon at all.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“They should have flags at the foot of their grave when they die,” Miller said. “Because although they’re not considered veterans, a lot of American soldiers owe their lives to them.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">***</p>
          <p class="storytext">As grateful as he was to build great friendships with the soldiers, Dna sometimes saw their kindness serving another purpose beyond genuine camaraderie.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“They make us happy because we always worry,” Dna said. “You don’t want new faces with bad attitudes. It never happens, disrespect or anything, because I think they feel sorry about me.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">The reason Dna and others like him were worried, and the reason that American soldiers felt sorry for them, was the dangerous reality interpreters faced.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Anti-American militant groups were able, and motivated, to identify interpreters working for the U.S. military and hunt them down. From there, they could murder them, their families or both.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Dna said that always, at every moment, he was scared for his own life and his family’s. It’s why, in 2007, he started the next phase of his journey - trying to make it to the United States.</p>
          <p class="storytext">He started by applying for a special program, which his boss clued him in on.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The National Defense Authorization Act of 2006 served only 50 Iraqis and Afghanis a year who were employed by the U.S. military. In 2007 and 2008, the time Dna applied, it was raised to 500 but was scaled back to 50 in 2009. It also required a general’s signature.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Despite the selective nature of the program, because of the relationships he built, Dna was first in line for the program.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“My boss said, ‘Tell nobody,’” Dna said. “Only for you I will do that.’”</p>
          <p class="storytext">So, he got the general’s signature, all the necessary paperwork was done, it was approved and then sent off to the necessary department.</p>
          <p class="storytext">And then it disappeared.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Dna said they tried to search for it but nothing turned up. After that, he waited about six months before reapplying, this time for a Special Immigrant Visa under the Kennedy-Lugar/Refugee Crisis Act of 2007.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Under this act, applicants need to supply proof of employment and a sponsor and a threat letter to prove they’re in danger, among other things. For Dna it was not as fast as the other process.</p>
          <p class="storytext">At one point, everything looked like it was finished: All the paperwork was completed, he had his interview and the interviewer told him he was welcome in America. All that was left was to wait two months, give or take 10 days, for his visa.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But the visa didn’t come.</p>
          <p class="storytext">About 20 days after the day, he was supposed to get his visa, he received an email that said the process was delayed and to expect it to take another year. In that year, he met his future wife, got married and had his process even further delayed because he had to work out a way to bring her to America as well.</p>
          <p class="storytext">He was also out of work for the military when troops starting pulling out of Iraq, but found a job working for an oil company as a safety man, then at another oil company as an engineer.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The entire time, though, he was living in fear that his past would come back to haunt him. That someone, somewhere had a picture of his face, knew he helped the Americans and wanted to kill him.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“There was not normality like before,” Dna said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But the duality of living in such imminent danger while the bureaucratic process strung him along wasn’t unique to Dna’s case. In fact, Dna’s case is unique in that he was able to see it through.</p>
          <p class="storytext">***</p>
          <p class="storytext">The Kennedy-Lugar/Refugee Crisis Act of 2007 authorized 5,000 visas a year from 2008 to 2012. To this date, only 5,500 visas, 22 percent of 20,000 allocated, have been awarded.</p>
          <p class="storytext">A similar program was created for Afghans in 2009 under the Afghan Allies Protection Act. There were 1,500 authorized visas per year from 2009 to 2013 but like the Iraqi predecessor, it’s fallen short with only 1,051 of Afghan visas awarded, 12 percent of the total issued.</p>
          <p class="storytext">This means thousands of Iraqis and Afghanis are trapped in a bureaucratic limbo. They hide in fear of retaliation from anti-American groups because they’re unable to prove employment or find a sponsor because everyone they knew from the military or its contracted companies left a long time ago.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Ashley Carr, a caseworker for Catholic Social Services in Lincoln said although it’s not her job, she spent countless days in refugees’ living rooms trying to track down members of the military through email or Facebook to help her clients’ friends trapped back home.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“These fuzzy photos dating ten years back with U.S. military men are their only hope,” Carr said. “They need that reference to come. In most cases, we never hear back, or find the right match.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">But even if everything is accounted for, the process can still be delayed, like it was in Dna’s case.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Still, knowing the unpredictability of the program and the danger that he faced every day, Dna was confident he would make it to America. And he was right, only he left part of himself behind in Iraq.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Because of technical error in interpretation, his name is now legally Marwan. A similar problem in Afghan visas is for the applicant to come through with the name “FNU,” which means “First Name Unknown.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">It’s another side-effect of the visa process where people like Dna and the FNU’s of the world are left with a permanent mark of what they had to endure to come to America.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But when Dna arrived with his wife in November of 2012, he said he didn’t care whether he was Mardan or Marwan. What mattered now is that he had finally made it. Made it to his fate.</p>
          <p class="storytext">To America.</p>
          <p class="storytext">***</p>
          <p class="storytext">Yazidi wedding music still plays in the background of Dna’s living room, but his family has turned their attention from the flat screen TV to their smartphones.</p>
          <p class="storytext">When his family first came to America last year, it was a culture shock: They didn’t understand English or American culture like Dna, but he said they’ve adjusted well. Dna and his wife even had a baby girl recently, a natural born U.S. citizen.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Dna’s plan to leave Iraq in the past is coming together naturally. It’s not always easy, though.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Sometimes, he thinks about the people who didn’t make it over. Especially in times like last summer, when ISIS began to execute Yazidis in northern Iraq and Dna’s cousin and great-uncle’s family went missing.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“We wish that people could be protected before, wish that the U.S. didn’t let ISIS invade these minority people,” Dna said. “It’s a war where families and kids become the victims, and no army got injured. I feel guilty, I wish, I wish, we could help.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">And Dna did try to improve things by petitioning with a group to get the government to take action. Nothing came of that though, other than handing off information to the government.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In a small way, he gives back to his people by working as an interpreter. Only this time, he’s speaking to American doctors trying to understand their refugee patient instead of an American soldier trying to understand an Iraqi local. It’s about letting them feel that same sort of progress he and his family have felt.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Because Dna said he didn’t come here to think about home or feel guilty about what he left behind. There’s a reason he came.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“I could go back home and work, but I don’t want to. I want to start over, new life, new country,” Dna said. “Over there is toward hell, it’s very bad. Over here, it’s a heaven.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">A heaven that he came to by means he can only describe as fate. He said he sometimes thinks about where he’d be if he hadn’t learned English in college, if he hadn’t met his friend who secured him the job at the safe base.</p>
          <p class="storytext">He wonders what he’d have done if he’d never met the nice boss who shook his hand when they first met and asked, “Are you Mardan?” He wonders what would have happened if he hadn’t met all the American soldiers who were so willing to help him make it to this place where his family can drink Mountain Dew between bites of naan and duqot.</p>
          <p class="storytext">All he can say is that it was fate. He was meant to make it to America—to heaven—to start a new life with his family in a new country. Even if it means a name change and leaving behind the home he knew.</p>
          <p class="storytext">He feels good about his and his family’s future. He knows that he won’t keep working at Catholic Social Services forever, that he needs to search for a different career, whether it’s as a teacher or something else.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But he knows wherever he goes, wherever fate leads him, that the constant factor that’s made his rebirth in America possible will be there.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“It’s because of people. People, how they are, how friendly, how helpful, smile on you,” Dna said. “Not mean people. Believe me, I’m not just making it up, that’s what I see.”</p>
