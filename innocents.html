          <img src="images/stories/innocents.jpg">
          <p>Story by Chris Bowling for the Daily Nebraskan | March 9, 2015</p>
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <p class="storytext">About a year ago, Walter Bircher became a guilty Innocent.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Or the least Innocent. He wasn’t sure what you call a person who drops out of the Innocents Society, because it doesn’t happen often. Semantics aside, Bircher decided he’d seen enough of the chancellor’s senior honorary after watching an inductee get tackled on a cold day last March.</p>
          <p class="storytext">That morning, the Innocents class had prepared the junior inductee – who requested the night before this story was published that his quotes and name be removed – like they would anyone else.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Relax your body. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth. Tilt your chin down and bend your knees.</p>
          <p class="storytext">And then – thwack.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The student, who appeared disoriented after the impact, was sent to the University Health Center for a brief concussion test, which he passed. Bircher told the other members that was it. He was leaving.</p>
          <p class="storytext">To Bircher, this tradition – blindfolding, circling and, one by one, charging at an inductee until the final member bull-rushes the student to the ground – was hazing. And he wanted no part in it.</p>
          <p class="storytext">And so he told them that. He stopped going to any meetings and his name was taken off the roster included with the minutes of the meetings. And if it wasn’t for the fact that his parents wanted him to receive recognition at Ivy Day, an appearance for which he said other members were reluctant to have, he would have severed all ties.</p>
          <div><img src="images/stories/innocents_minutes.jpg">
Pictured: An excerpt from the minutes for the Innocents Society meeting following the tackling incident. The minutes were confirmed independently by multiple former Innocents members and show discussion about possibly issuing a public statement. The statement was never issued.</div>
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <p class="storytext">On Friday, popular blog Total Frat Move published a video sent by an anonymous UNL student allegedly depicting one of the tackling ceremonies. The headline: “Check out this video of the University of Nebraska openly endorsing hazing.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">The undated 12-second clip shows a black-robed figure standing surrounded by red-robed figures. Nine of the red robes run past the person in the center, coming close but avoiding contact. Then the 10th person grabs the black-robed figure around the middle and brings him – or her – to the ground. Everyone cheers.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The ceremony was an example of “university sponsored and supported hazing,” the tipster said in an email. The writer draws a comparison between the tackling and acts of hazing that other student organizations, especially Greek ones, are punished for at UNL.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The University of Nebraska-Lincoln Student Code of Conduct defines hazing as follows:
          <p class="storytext">“Any activity by an organization or by a member of an organization in which a member, prospective member, pledge or associate of the organization is subjected to acts which cause harm or create the risk of harm to the physical or mental health of the member, prospective member, or pledge.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Student organizations that participate in hazing are eligible for a variety of sanctions ranging from a warning to expulsion, as outlined in the Student Code of Conduct.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In 2012, multicultural sorority Sigma Lambda Gamma faced a year of suspension as punishment for hazing that included making students wear robes, keeping them awake for long hours and forcing them to carry eggs for a week as part of an initiation ritual.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The Daily Nebraskan couldn't locate any record of university sanctions relating to the Innocents' tackling of inductees.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Innocents adviser Michelle Waite didn’t return a phone call requesting comments for this story. Ben Zitek, another adviser tasked with answering applicants’ questions about the tackling ceremony, didn’t answer a Sunday afternoon request for comment.</p>
          <p class="storytext">To Bircher, the group is guilty of hazing. And he said the tackling ceremony isn’t the only questionable practice the Innocents endorses.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Bircher said he experienced other forms of hazing during his initiation week in 2013, including seemingly harmless things such as carrying around a red bandana and a deck of cards everywhere he went. He was reprimanded when older class members found out he wasn’t doing either.</p>
          <p class="storytext">It became not-so-harmless, though, when members of the older class came into his room in the middle of the night, woke him up, blindfolded him and drove him around for 40 minutes, while playing eerie music, until they had him stand on the edge of a highway for five or 10 minutes.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Afterward, they met up with other members for a celebratory “we made it” kind of meal, but Bircher didn’t feel like the experience had brought him closer to the group. If anything, he said, it pushed him away. Other Innocents members declined to confirm Bircher’s story.</p>
          <p class="storytext">And while websites with features such as “Instagram Babe of the Day” aren’t necessarily the best news sources, combined with stories like Bircher’s, they raise a few questions.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Some former members wonder: If the Innocents is a collection of UNL’s top leaders and brightest students, why is the tackling still happening? And what does it say about UNL?</p>
          <p class="storytext">The answer lies in one of the Innocents’ integral components: tradition.</p>
          <p class="storytext">***</p>
          <p class="storytext">For a society approaching its 112th anniversary, traditions matter. And through two world wars, a limbo period in the ‘70s and a revitalization in the ‘80s, tackling has endured as one of the group’s most prominent ceremonies.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In early days, hundreds would flock to view the tacklings. In the ‘40s, new Innocents were inducted months early out of fear they would be drafted. Today, tackling remains an integral part of the Innocents’ identity.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Members have a defense against allegations of hazing. They say inductees don’t have to be tackled if they don’t want to.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The Innocents is upfront on its membership application that inductees may opt out of the ceremony. But Peter Bock, a former Innocents member and UNL alumnus, said this hardly ever happens because no one wants to be the person who disrupts the tradition.</p>
          <p class="storytext">And while he wouldn’t comment on last year’s tackling incident or brand the tackling ceremony as hazing, he said the Innocents need to retire the tradition.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“If you look at it objectively, it’s a huge injury risk,” Bock said. “It’s a liability for the university; it’s a very public thing that isn’t necessary. And the only reason I think it’s stuck around is because of the traditional aspect and that’s the way things were.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Bock called the continuation of the practice “ridiculous” and said it doesn’t reflect well on the university.</p>
          <p class="storytext">We’re supposed to be a representation of the brightest people at UNL, and the fact that we get hung up on doing things for the sake of tradition and put people at risk of injury is silly,” Bock said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But because the tackling is voluntary, it exists in a grey area that allows the Innocents to continue the tradition in spite of accidents similar to last year’s. Innocents President Joe Farley, a senior mechanical engineering major, defended the practice.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“It’s OK because things happen,” Farley said. “The important thing is that you address it afterwards and make sure that it doesn’t happen again.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">In light of what happened last year, the goal with this year’s tackling was to avoid similar accidents, Farley said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“We addressed that and we didn’t have any incident this year because we wanted to essentially protect the individuals we were selecting,” Farley said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In the past, Farley said, some members may have more harshly tackled inductees whom they knew personally, resulting in rougher impacts. Farley said he and the rest of the Innocents hope to start a trend of safer tackling.</p>
          <p class="storytext">That’s not an entirely new sentiment. The inductee who inspired Bircher’s departure from the Innocents had been coached to avoid injury.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Bircher said allowing the tackling to continue sets a dangerous precedent for future classes of the Innocents.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“It keeps going and nobody asks, ‘Why are we doing this?’” Bircher said. “Why are we creating all this hardship for people aside from the fact that it’s the way it’s always been done?”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Former Innocent and UNL alumnus Qianli Wang brought up another argument in defense of the tackling: The practice, although physical in nature, doesn’t carry malicious intent.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“It is simply a ceremonial gesture,” Wang said in an email. “It is not done forcefully. It is not done with any intent to harm, intimidate, or embarrass.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">The Student Code of Conduct addresses that form of defense:</p>
          <p class="storytext">“The intent of any person engaging in hazing activity or the consent or cooperation of any person who is a victim of hazing will not constitute a defense to an allegation of misconduct for hazing.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Bircher and Bock said it’s time for change. And it’s not like change is unheard of for the Innocents: Over the years, the group has transcended from an all-white, all-male society with an impression of secrecy to today’s diverse organization with an online roster and a Twitter account.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But one thing that hasn’t changed is, perhaps, the group’s most important byproduct of all: lasting friendships.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Wang, who’s an immigrant from China, said the relationships and camaraderie he formed with “the best students on campus” are invaluable to him. Bock said he hopes to keep for life the friends he made through Innocents.</p>
          <p class="storytext">For Bircher? Not so much. His relationships with fellow Innocents were tense last year because he had a hard time assimilating to the group, and leaving definitely didn’t help. But even he admits the group serves a purpose on campus.</p>
          <p class="storytext">***</p>
          <p class="storytext">For the Innocents, the trademark red robes are a symbol of unity. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. The voices of 13 are greater than one.</p>
          <p class="storytext">And some members, it appears, have little tolerance for dissent. That much was evident Friday night after Bircher commented on the Total Frat Move article on his Facebook and later received a call from an alumna. Take down the article, he recalled her saying, sending a message that he considered threatening, petty and a power-move all at once. Her message was simple.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“People will not be happy.”</p>

          <h1 class="storytitle2">Innocents tackling isn't hazing, administrators say</h1>
          <img src="images/stories/innocents.jpg">
          <p>Story by Chris Bowling for the Daily Nebraskan | March 12, 2015</p>
          <p class="storytext">University officials are defending the Innocents Society’s tradition of tackling inductees, after hazing allegations surfaced in a Daily Nebraskan article on Monday.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Much of the debate centers on competing interpretations of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Student Code of Conduct. UNL Chancellor Harvey Perlman pointed to article III, section eight of the code in an email defending the tradition, which sent one inductee to the University Health Center with concussion-like symptoms last year. An example of tackling is depicted in a video posted on popular blog Total Frat Move last week.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In accordance with the particular guideline, which outlines acceptable practices for initiation rituals, the Innocents’ tackling ceremony doesn’t require exertion, deprivation or embarrassment over a sustained period of time, Perlman said. Nor does it damage anyone’s reputation.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But Perlman, an honorary Innocents member, didn’t explain how the tackling falls beyond the reach of the code of conduct’s definition of hazing. The definition is outlined in article III section seven: “any activity by which a person intentionally or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health or safety of an individual for the purpose of initiation into, admission into, affiliation with, or continued membership with any student organization.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">In Monday’s article, Innocents alumnus Walter Bircher decried the voluntary tradition as hazing. He admitted to having partaken in the ritual, which involves blindfolding, circling and, one by one, whirling past an inductee until a final member slams the student to the ground. But he said he’d had enough after last year’s incident that sent a student to the health center.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Perlman said stretching the definition of hazing runs the risk of criminalizing innocuous behaviors.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“If tackling by Innocents as a condition of membership is prohibited, then what about (the) tackling drill to make the football team?” Perlman said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But what can separate sports teams and some ROTCs with groups like the Innocents is supervision from trained, school-sanctioned professionals, said Emily N. Pualwan, executive director of anti-hazing advocacy group HazingPrevention.org.</p>
          <p class="storytext">She said the presence of professionals can ensure safety and help eliminate questions about what is and isn’t hazing.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“Hazing’s gray areas (and there are plenty) are of particular concern at the high school and college level, because young adults do not often know when to stop, and incidents get out of control very quickly,” Pualwan wrote in an email.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Perlman also defended tackling because the practice is advertised in advance -- a requirement laid out in the code of conduct -- and inductees give their consent.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The code of conduct states, however, that participants’ consent is irrelevant if a practice constitutes hazing.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“The intent of any person engaging in hazing activity or the consent or cooperation of any person who is a victim of hazing will not constitute a defense to an allegation of misconduct for hazing,” it says.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Pualwan said her group — and most, if not all, universities — don’t accept the “willingness to participate” defense as an excuse for hazing.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“Volunteering and signing a release form to participate in a ‘tackling ceremony’ does not absolve anyone from the potential dangerous consequences of that activity,” Pualwan said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Michelle Waite, assistant to the chancellor and advisor to the Innocents Society, did not respond to phone calls or emails and passed the Daily Nebraskan’s questions along to Steve Smith, the UNL spokesman.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“We are confident that the members of the Innocents Society handled this situation appropriately, that this ceremony is carried out with no intent to harm, and is conducted in a respectful manner,” Smith said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Smith cited the code of conduct’s definition of hazing as defense of tackling but didn’t explain how the definition doesn’t apply to the tackling initiation.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Ben Zitek, another adviser tasked with answering applicants’ questions about the tackling ceremony, and Juan Franco, vice chancellor for Student Affairs, did not return phone calls or emails.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Dean of Students Matt Hecker declined to outline a general procedural process of how hazing punishments are approached because each is taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Joe Farley, president of the Innocents Society, wouldn’t confirm whether the Total Frat Move video involved Innocents members or address questions regarding the status of the initiation ceremony.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Pualwan, in her personal experience, hasn’t seen a lot of things like the Innocents’ tackling ceremony. She didn’t have a comment on whether it can be classified as hazing, but she said such debate is common.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“Well-intentioned people often disagree on when the hazing line is crossed,” Pualwan said. “Being active, however, in investigating and addressing suspected hazing behavior is imperative.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">She also said it’s not unheard of for acts like the tackling ceremony, which seem harmless and have safety precautions, to have unintended consequences. One example she cited was scavenger hunts, which many colleges have banned because they’ve resulted in car accidents and theft charges.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“We do not always know what will turn serious very quickly,” she said.</p>
