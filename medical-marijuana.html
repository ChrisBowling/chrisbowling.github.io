          <img src="images/stories/marijuana.jpg">
          <p>Story by Chris Bowling for the Daily Nebraskan | April 20, 2015</p>
          <p class="storytext">Josie Kranz is a fighter.</p>
          <p class="storytext">When her husband, Chistopher Kranz, was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, a major brain tumor, in December 2012, the doctors told them that he had six to eight months to live — 12 to 14 if he wanted to go through radiation and chemotherapy. But Josie Kranz didn’t take this as a death sentence.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“My sister was this warrior,” Josie Kranz’s sister Katie Philippi said. “She carried the energy; not only for him, but for the whole family. It was just like, ‘we’re going to fight this.’ There was no other option for her.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">So they traveled around the country and the world, seeing different professionals in search of the right diet, homeopathic medicine or anything that could reduce the tumor and stop his seizures. After a year of this without much improvement, a friend suggested they try cannabis oil.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Christopher Kranz was hesitant at first because of the stigma attached to cannabis, but the results were clear at his monthly brain scans. The tumor was shrinking.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But it left Kranz in a state of disrepair. He was blind, without most of his motor skills and unable to do almost anything without help.</p>
          <p class="storytext">After the experience, Philippi’s entire family became advocates for the health benefits of marijuana, combing through mountains of research that she said wasn’t getting a fair say in the medical community.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“There’s just a lot of research out there that’s been done and it’s not really looked at in the U.S. from a medical standpoint because it’s not the big studies the pharmaceutical companies sponsor,” Philippi said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">They’d seen it firsthand and now they were convinced marijuana was a treatment that had medical benefits. The problem was, and still is, that some doctors and the American Medical Association refuse to back it because of its current classification as a Schedule 1 substance, which means the drug cannot be medically prescribed.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Philippi knew that someone needed to make an effort to change the gridlocked mindset on cannabis. So, on the last day to draft a bill for the Nebraska Legislature, she put together what became LB643, the Cannabis Compassion and Care Act. The bill advanced from committee Monday afternoon.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Sen. Tommy Garrett knew a little bit about medical marijuana when Philippi and her family brought the drafted bill to him. Last year, he watched a bill pushing for more research on the medical benefits of cannabis flounder – mainly because the bill lacked support from the University of Nebraska Medical Center, which was essential for its passage.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But he was aware of the ties this issue had with the people and families of Nebraska. That’s why after seeing the bill struggle and hearing the stories of Philippi’s family and others, Garrett said he was done waiting around for someone else to make a change.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“At this point in my life, I’m just like, ‘Let’s get stuff done. Let’s make things happen,’” Garrett said. “And if UNMC doesn’t want to get on board, then tough. We’ll proceed without them.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">But even though he felt strongly about the bill, Garrett didn’t have high hopes for it.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“When I first brought this up I thought, ‘OK, I’m going to do it for the families,’ and I fully expected to get my limbs ripped off,” Garrett said. “I thought they would tear me to pieces.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Part of this is because of the stigma attached to the idea of cannabis usage in any context. This is especially true in a conservative state like Nebraska, which is one of two states suing Colorado after it legalized recreational cannabis.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Even in a medical sense, some Nebraska conservatives talk about the “slippery slope” of the issue; in other words, that any legalization will open the floodgates and make cannabis more available for illegal recreational use.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Mark Overman, Scotts Bluff county sheriff, said Garrett’s bill is a move in the wrong direction.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“It’s a door-opener,” Overman said. “That’s the gateway to legalization of (recreational) marijuana.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Even though Garrett said he’s not an advocate for recreational cannabis legalization, Overman said that’s not a good compromise. The bottom line is Overman likes how Nebraska currently handles marijuana — a minor possession is an infraction, treated in the same way as a speeding ticket — and there’s no reason to change that.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Overman said that smoking — no matter what substance is being smoked — is a dangerous way to put anything into a body. And he said that if there was any reason to think that medical marijuana had benefits, the FDA would have already supported it by now. To him, passing this bill now would be the first step toward more the presence of cannabis and more crime.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But that’s a concern that’s fading nationwide as more states legalize cannabis medically and recreationally.</p>
          <p class="storytext">With 23 states and the District of Columbia passing legislation and 13 more looking at it, it’s a growing trend of acceptance toward the benefits of a drug that’s been stigmatized for so long.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But even though the trend is growing, opposition is not erased. That’s why people like Paige Figi, a medical cannabis activist, think the battle in Nebraska is so critical.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“It shows that this is a nonpartisan issue,” Figi said. “It shows that while Nebraska may struggle with enforcing prosecution for recreational abuse; they are in support of their population of suffering patients having safe, responsible access and are able to separate the two issues entirely.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Figi, a Colorado resident, became an activist for medical cannabis after using low-THC cannabis oil to treat her 5-year-old daughter who nearly died from extreme epileptic seizures. She’s currently working in Congress and various legislatures around the United States to show the issue doesn’t have to be so black and white. A victory in Nebraska would further cement that ideal.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“It sends a loud message to middle America and other Republican states that have historically opposed medical cannabis reform that it can be done and regulated in such way that makes recreational use opposition comfortable,” Figi said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">And as for making this a non-partisan issue and sending a message to Republican states that object to medical cannabis on principle, Garrett feels he’s the man for the job.</p>
          <p class="storytext">He’s a conservative from Bellevue with the Nebraska Firearm Owners Association button to prove it. But transcending political divides has been easier said than done.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Garrett is constantly under fire from his colleagues who have said his conservative compass is broken. One peer told him in private that he should go to the committee in secret and tell them to kill the bill there so it wouldn’t catch media attention and ruin his chances of reelection.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But through all the negativity, Garrett said he’s inspired to keep fighting by the overwhelming support he’s received from families and people suffering with ailments for which medical cannabis is an option.</p>
          <p class="storytext">One story that sticks out with him is a 23-year-old woman who suffers from severe seizures, who is on Medicaid and is under the care of her mother.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The government is paying $35,000 a year for pills, he said, and that doesn’t even include doctor visits or any other medical expense- none of which are working.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Her next step is a frontal lobectomy, otherwise known as a lobotomy.</p>
          <p class="storytext">When the Cannabis Compassion and Care Act was heard in committee on March 9, one hundred similar people came to testify under similar circumstances. Whether they had Crohn’s disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s or a number of others ailments, they all wanted that cannabis option treatment. It’s these people and these stories that drive Garrett.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“We’ve got to do this, and I’m going to fight like hell to make it happen,” Garrett said.</p>
