          <h1> WELCOME</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name's Chris Bowling. I'm a reporter, designer and photographer from Cincinnati, Ohio currently studying journalism at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in Lincoln, Nebraska</p>
                <p>Throughout my website I've included stories I've written, photos I've taken as well as my resume and further outlets to see some of my work which I hope can give you an idea of the kind of motivations and products of my work. You'll find I have an interest in long-form reporting through stories I've done on an Iraqi translators journey to America. There's breaking news with stories of traffic accidents in downtown Lincoln. In addition you'll find features, sports photography, portraits and many more that show case my experience in the journalism field.</p>
                <p>When I'm not reporting I love playing guitar, watching football or reading a good biography. Ask me about J.D. Salinger sometime.</p>
