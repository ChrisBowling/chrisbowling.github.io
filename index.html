                <p class="storytext">Hello, my name's Chris Bowling. I'm a reporter, designer and photographer from Cincinnati, Ohio currently studying journalism at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in Lincoln, Nebraska</p>
          <p class="storytext">Throughout my website I've included stories I've written, photos I've taken as well as my resume and further outlets to see more of my work. </p>
          <p class="storytext">Although I love to to tell stories through a variety of mediums my true passion is writing. 
              <p class="storytext">I started writing at my high school's newsmagazine, the Spark, in Liberty Township, Ohio. I didn't have a lot of previous experience so I mainly started writing music and movie reviews. From there I became interested in longer pieces, features and news stories that eventually led me to become editor-in-chief of the award-winning staff of 100.</p>
          <p class="storytext">After that I followed my passion to Lincoln, Nebraska where I worked with news, sports, arts and opinion at the Daily Nebraskan. Now after a summer covering news in Norfolk, Nebraska and a semester spent with the Journal Star in Lincoln, Nebraska I'm looking to take the next step.</p>
          <p class="storytext">You'll find I have an interest in long-form reporting through stories I've done on an Iraqi translator's journey to America as well as the state of the death penalty in Nebraska. You'll also find an interest in breaking news with stories of fatal traffic accidents in downtown Lincoln. In addition I've included features, photography and many more pieces that showcase my experience in the journalism field.</p>
                <p class="storytext">When I'm not reporting I love playing guitar, watching football or reading a good biography. Ask me about J.D. Salinger sometime.</p>
