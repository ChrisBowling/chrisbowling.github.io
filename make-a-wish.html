          <img src="images/stories/makeawish.jpg">
          <p>Story by Chris Bowling for the Lincoln Journal Star</p>
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <p class="storytext">It was the day before school started when Nick Herringer found out his wish was granted.</p>
          <p class="storytext">After floating the idea around since April, the news finally came that the Make-A-Wish foundation was making his dream possible. Tammy Herringer, his mom, brought home a Dairy Queen cake, and the family celebrated the news.</p>
          <p class="storytext">They celebrated because Nick, a 15-year-old from Hastings who was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma brain cancer in February, was going to get the car of his dreams.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Seven weeks later, in the parking lot of GP Customs in Lincoln, Nick sat behind the wheel of the 2011 white Dodge Avenger with every feature, addition and upgrade he’d put on his wish list.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“This blows my mind,” Herringer said. “It’s way past what I ever thought it would look like.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">When asked about what GP customs did with the car, mechanic Kyle Blyth said the better question would be what they didn’t do, because that list is much shorter.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In addition to a custom wrapping job, the car also has halo headlights, a Sony G3 sound system, 20-inch black rims, dual exhaust, four-button remote start and a laundry list of other features. It was by no means a typical job for the shop, which works on everything from trucks to supercars, but it was a job that had a special purpose.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“There was a lot of work, a lot of blood and a lot of love that went into this car,” Blyth said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The ultimate payoff, though, was the reveal. Blyth, who remembers loving cars as much as Nick when he was a kid, said it didn’t get better than seeing him crank up the stereo.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“The louder it got, the bigger the smile became,” Blyth said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">GP Customs owner Robert Peinado said the shop put around 150 hours of work into the car over the span of 45 days. He said if this were a retail job, parts and labor would have run anywhere between $17,000 and $20,000.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Make-A-Wish provided for the custom work. When the Herringers learned of the gift, they bought the car themselves through a friend who works at Hastings Ford.</p>
          <p class="storytext">This isn’t the first time the Herringers have seen strangers come together in support of their son.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Nick was taken to the hospital in late January after having intense headaches for a few days. The doctors did an MRI, found out he had a tumor the size of an orange in his brain and rushed him to the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.</p>
          <p class="storytext">The doctors performed surgery and removed all of the tumor and cyst wall. Later on, a pathology report confirmed Nick had stage 4 glioblastoma brain cancer.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Since then, the community has rallied behind him. In April, there was a spaghetti dinner and silent auction at Berean Bible Church. Nick said they had expected about 150 people to show up.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Instead, more than 600 people came.</p>
          <p class="storytext">There’s also a fundraising page for his medical bills on GoFundMe.com that has raised $3,485 from 66 donors.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But Tammy Herringer said what’s more important than the numbers of dollars, fundraisers or pounds of spaghetti that have come from this journey is the people.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“You can’t go to Wal-Mart without someone hugging you,” she said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Nick said he has experienced the same support, and that it’s amazing every time he hears it.</p>
          <p class="storytext">What’s more is that even when things get hard, the Herringers know there are people going through the same thing they can reach out to. Tammy Herringer said there’s a family in Kennesaw with a daughter fighting the same cancer as Nick. They have helped out by suggesting questions to ask, recommending doctors and just generally being there for them.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But possibly the most reassuring aspect of this whole experience is that even though Nick is fighting a rare, aggressive form of cancer, not much has changed.</p>
          <p class="storytext">His mother said Nick is a regular student at Hastings High School, worked all summer mowing lawns, and is still able to hang out with his friends and be a kid.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Some of the only changes are that Nick can’t play football and that he has to go to Omaha every week for chemotherapy, which he’ll have to do until May of next year.</p>
          <p class="storytext">As for his future, the family is optimistic. After meeting other kids like Nick who have been in remission for three, seven or even nine years, they’re hopeful Nick’s story can be the same.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But Tammy Herringer said they’re not getting ahead of themselves, though, and that they’re always prepared to take on another tumor if it ever crops up. The only difference now is that they know what they’re up against.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But all of that wasn’t a conversation for Friday. The conversations about chemo, medical bills and the challenging journey thus far were gone, replaced by guys talking about car specs and appreciating a truly one-of-a-kind ride.</p>
          <p class="storytext">It was a day where the only challenge that lay ahead was how Nick can convince his parents to let him take the car out alone while he still only has a learner's permit.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But most of all, it was a day to enjoy the ride back to Hastings, because Nick wasn’t just driving home in style. He was driving home in a dream come true.</p>
