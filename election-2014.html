          <p class="storytext">Republicans won big in Nebraska on Tuesday night, taking the governor’s office and a soon-to-be vacant U.S. Senate seat by wide margins as the party took hold of U.S. Congress.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“We did it,” governor-elect Pete Ricketts told a crowd of hundreds gathered at the Cornhusker Hotel.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Ricketts paused as the crowd cheered, shouting and chanting his name in the packed ballroom. He was joined on stage by 12 others including lieutenant governor-elect Mike Foley, who served as state auditor before joining Ricketts in September, as well as his family.</p>
          <p class="storytext">In his speech, Ricketts joked with the crowd, thanked his campaign staff and rounded out the speech by stating that tonight is a night for the Republicans to celebrate, but that he still needs their help in the coming years.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“God Bless,” Ricketts said to end his short remarks, thanking everyone who came out to support him.</p>
          <p class="storytext">He turned to kiss and hug his wife and family as people continued the cheering and shouts of “Amen” that have been heard at Republican watch parties all night.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Not far away in the Grand Manse, Nebraska’s newly elected Senator-elect Ben Sasse took the stage to a similar electric crowd.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Sasse spoke about the nature of government and said that “Washington D.C. doesn’t make America great.” He pledged to be a voice for the people of Nebraska.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“I want to be accountable to you because you’re the bosses,” Sasse said to the crowd.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Sasse also spoke about his trip across Nebraska and meeting people from different walks of life. Specifically, he addressed a Hispanic community that might not traditionally gravitate toward Republican ideals. He said Latinos are concerned with issues beyond immigration.</p>
          <p class="storytext">It was all a part of his battle cry of “go big or go home,” which he said became increasingly popular during his state-wide tour. He paused while people cheered and chanted the slogan Tuesday night.</p>
          <p class="storytext">But before the results came in and before the newly elected governor and United States senator took the stage, Republicans were energetic.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Gavin Fusco, a freshman political science and prelaw major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln said the crowd was confident in its candidates’ chances as it enjoyed beverages and mingled in the Grand Manse.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“Everyone’s pretty ecstatic here,” Fusco said. “He’s a down to earth guy and a self-made man. That’s something that everyone here likes about him.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Another rally attendant, Kurt Krugprad, took as a sign the atmosphere and election results, which were fed into the room and projected on the wall.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“It’s a message against Obama,” Krugprad said. “It’s a referendum that says, ‘This is it and that we didn’t like how you were leading us.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">Soon after the results came in that Sasse had come out on top of Democratic opponent Dave Domina, several people took the stage, including Nebraska’s reelected U.S. congressman, Jeff Fortenberry.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“I got my ballot this morning, and the first thing I did was put that check next to Ben Sasse’s name,” Fortenberry said.</p>
          <p class="storytext">Deb Fischer, Sasse’s new fellow Republican Nebraskan in the U.S. senate, also celebrated Sasse’s, as well as the Republicans’, victory Tuesday night.</p>
          <p class="storytext">“We have the momentum; we have the people; we have the values,” Fischer said. “We are going to see a renewal of this country.”</p>
          <p class="storytext">But whether it was Ricketts or Sasse, both watch parties were bursting with excitement for the future. And when it came time to leave the stage, both Ricketts and Sasse exited to resounding cheers and the waving of their campaign posters, taking in the support as newly elected public officials.</p>
